# Software Design - Practical June
This repository contains the practice of June the subject of Software Design of the University of A Coru√±a in the degree of computer engineering second course 2022/2023

## Statement
A hotel and catering company commissions us to develop a point-of-sale terminal (POS) system for the management of orders (orders to the waiter) and their collection, as well as the control of the stock of products in a restaurant.
For this we need to design and implement the main core that will support the rest of the application. This core has to take into account several aspects: products, stocks, orders, collections and cash closures.

The aim of the exercise was to use OOP design principles and patterns to solve the problem, together with class and dynamic diagrams.

The design patterns and principles used are explained in the [report](https://github.com/migueldeoleiros/DS-OP2/tree/main/GEI-DS-614G010152122-OP2/doc)
